# Rain-Prediction-ANN
My goal is to build an artificial neural network(ANN) in this project which predicts if it would rain tomorrow or not. This dataset contains about 10 years of daily weather observations from numerous Australian weather stations.RainTomorrow is the target variable to predict. It means -- did it rain the next day, Yes or No? This column is Yes if the rain for that day was 1mm or more.
